# Introduction
This repository contains files from course activities to integrate (i.e., teach) advanced data skills using Artifical Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) tools to undergraduate biomedical engineering students. These activities were developed in the Georgia Institute of Technology Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering.

# List of course activities with short descriptions of course and activity
Note: Newly developed activities are typically posted after at least two rounds of classroom testing. The developers treat each repository as reflecting the best-current state of the activity when first published. We do not post versions from the testing and development process.
## Systems Physiology (released)   
###  Course
An introduction to human physiology emphasizing biomedical engineering approaches to the understanding of basic organ function, disease states, and medical intervention.
###  Activity 
Students use data from the [2017 George B. Moody PhysioNet challenge]([url](https://physionet.org/content/challenge-2017/1.0.0/)) to create and evaluate a machine learning model to diagnosis Atrial Fibrillation. The activity has two versions, one that requires student access to advanced GPU computing hardware and one that doesn't. In the activity, students manually diagnose randomly drawn ECG waveforms for atrial fibrilation, train neural networks on a large ECG data set (some versions), run inference using their model, evaluate the efficacy of the model, train and/or run inference on an improved model that uses signals processing tools for feature extraction. The activity requires students to think critically, reflect, and run code. While the activity does not require students to write code, it woudl be simple to modify it to create such opportunities. The activity is written for the Matlab coding language.
